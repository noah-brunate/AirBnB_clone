# :books: AirBnB Clone :pen:

# Description
> This is one phase of the `AirBnB Clone`: the `HTML` and `CSS` part.
> The Images folder holds `icons` for the site (e.g. `logo icon`, `bathroom icons`, `bedroom icons`,
`guest icons`, `Tv icon`, `wifi icon`). 
> The Styles folder holds CSS styling files. The largest numbered
style file of each category (e.g. `common`, `footer`, `header`, `places`) is most
relevant to the finished product. 
> The highlest numbered index.html file is likewise the most relevant to the finished product.
